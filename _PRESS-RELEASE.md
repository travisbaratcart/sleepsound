There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Sleep Sound ##

## The bay-area lazy commuter alarm ##

## Summary ##
  Wake up at the last possible minute. Sleep Sound syncs your alarm with your commute, waking you up early if the trains or running late or letting you sleep in if everything is on time. Input all your possible commute routes and Sleep Sound will adjust on the fly to wake you for the best route.

## Problem ##
  If you want to make it to work on time regularly, currently you need to wake up for the worst-case. If your train regularly runs a half hour late, you'll need to wake up a half hour early to be sure you'll be on time.

## Solution ##
  By syncing your alarm with the 511 api, you an stop waking up for the worst case and start waking up only when you need to today!

## Quote from the dev ##
  (Travis was unable to comment as he is still asleep.)

## How to Get Started ##
  Visit sleepsound.com (maybe at some point in the future). Input the routes you would consider taking to work, as well as the time you would wake up if you took those routes. Sleep Sound will wake you up as late as possible so that you can still make it to work on time and provide you with today's recommended route.

## Customer Quote ##
