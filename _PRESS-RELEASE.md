# Sleep Sound #

## The bay-area smart commuter alarm ##

## Summary ##
  Wake up at the last possible minute. Sleep Sound syncs your alarm with your commute, waking you up early if the trains or running late or letting you sleep in if everything is on time. Input all your possible commute routes and Sleep Sound will adjust on the fly to wake you for the best route.

## Problem ##
  If you want to make it to work on time regularly, currently you need to wake up for the worst-case. If your train regularly runs a half hour late, you'll need to wake up a half hour early to be sure you'll be on time.

## Solution ##
  By syncing your alarm with the 511 api, you an stop waking up for the worst case and start waking up only when you need to today!

## How to Get Started ##
  Visit sleepsound.com (maybe at some point in the future). Input the routes you would consider taking to work, as well as the time you would wake up if you took those routes. Sleep Sound will wake you up as late as possible so that you can still make it to work on time and provide you with today's recommended route.
