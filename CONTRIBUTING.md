# Contributing

## General Workflow

1. Fork the repo
1. Cut a feature branch from master
1. Make commits to your feature branch.
1. When you've finished with your fix or feature, Rebase upstream changes into your branch. submit a pull request
   directly to master. Include a description of your changes.
1. Your pull request will be reviewed by another maintainer.
1. Fix any issues raised by your code reviwer, and push your fixes as a single
   new commit.
1. Once the pull request has been reviewed, it will be merged by another member of the team. Do not merge your own commits.

### Guidelines

1. Uphold the current code standard:
    - Keep your code [DRY][].
1. Run the [tests][] before submitting a pull request.
1. Tests are very, very important. Submit tests if your pull request contains
   new, testable behavior.
